## Requirements

- Python 3.7+  
- [FFmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/) installed and added to your system PATH

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo-name.git
   cd your-repo-name
   
   
2. Install dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt


3. Prepare your .env file with Spotify credentials.
The .env file is already set up for you, but it is recommended to replace the Spotify Client ID and Client Secret with your own for better reliability and to avoid usage limits.

Example .env content:

SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID=your_spotify_client_id
SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET=your_spotify_client_secret
You can get your own credentials at the Spotify Developer Dashboard.

4. Make sure FFmpeg is installed and accessible from your system's command line.

Usage
Run the script:

python launch.py
You will be prompted to choose a platform and enter the media URL.

2: Download YouTube audio (MP3)

3: Download SoundCloud audio (MP3)

4: Download Spotify track (finds best matching YouTube audio and downloads with metadata)
